Hi! I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. I work primarily on
first language acquisition and syntax. I combine theoretical, experimental, and computational approaches to explore the
mechanisms of language and of language learning. My advisor is [Charles Yang](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/).

Before coming to UPenn, I got my B.S. at MIT double majoring in Computer Science (6-3) and Linguistics (24-2).

I am from Boulder, Colorado, where I enjoyed hiking, skiing, and spending time outside. Beyond linguistics, my Christian 
faith is important to me, and I enjoy cooking (mostly Korean food but also other foods too!), hand-lettering, playing 
guitar, and making things in general!
