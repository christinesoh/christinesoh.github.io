I'll be giving a poster at [CogSci](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2023/) via the virtual platform UnderLine.
I'll be sharing some results looking at how word-meaning pairs are learned with intervening learning trials..
The proceedings for this talk can be found [here](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/26c2339w).
