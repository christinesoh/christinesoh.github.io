I'll be giving a poster at [WOW 2023](https://wordsintheworld.ca/wow-conference/conference-schedule-wow2023/) on Saturday, December 2 at 13:10 EDT.
The poster is titled "When things go missing: Referent absence in noun cross situational word learning," which has an experiment that asks,
what happens when target referents are absent?
