I'll be giving a talk at [NELS53](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3045/program) at 10:45 CET on January 14, 2023.
I will be talking about *case in Sakha*, contributing to a theoretical argument on Dependent Case vs. Case-by-Agree.
Here are the [handout](https://csohyue.github.io/assets/pdf/Yue_NELS53_Sakha_say.pdf) and [slides](https://csohyue.github.io/assets/pdf/Yue_NELS53_slides.pdf).
